# Deep Learning Techniques for Artistic Image Transformations
This repository contains info about the dataset used and the code for experiments done in our paper Deep Learning Techniques for Artistic Image Transformations: A Survey.

The file 'BW to Color - Forest Dataset Info.txt' contains links to the Forest dataset that we prepared for our experiment to recolor grayscale images with few-shot learning. The images for this dataset have been collected from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) - a free stock photos website.

The code along with a few resulting images for the artistic image transformations - Style Transfer and Recoloring Grayscale Images are present in Jupyter Notebooks in the repo.
